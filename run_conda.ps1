run_conda.ps1
Robust Miniforge -> conda bootstrap for Windows (x86_64 or ARM64)
Place this script in the project root (next to requirements.txt) and run from PowerShell.
Usage (from project root):
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -File .\run_conda.ps1
This script will:
 - detect platform (ARM64 vs x86_64)
 - try multiple download methods for the Miniforge installer
 - validate the downloaded file (size + PE header)
 - run the installer elevated (interactive)
 - locate conda.exe and create a conda env named 'speech2textrme'
 - install binary deps from conda-forge (numpy, numba, meson, ninja)
 - pip-install the remaining requirements.txt into the conda env

If automatic download fails, the script will instruct you to download manually.
